# FeatureExtractionTechnique
Feature extraction technique test.

**Language: R**

**Start: 2019**

## Why
[Dimensionality Reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction) is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration. It can be divided into two major approaches:

* [Feature selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection): tries to find a subset of the input variables 
* [Feature extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction): (aka Feature projection) transforms the data in the high-dimensional space to a space of fewer dimensions.

I wanted to compare three _Feature extraction_ techniques:

* t-SNE
* UMAP
* PCA

using the notorious Iris dataset.
